>## Arrays
>Arrays are a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).

>### Operations
>1. Access
>2. Search
>3. Insertion
>4. Deletion

>### Implementation
>1. [Array](https://github.com/ricardo1470/Data-Structures/blob/master/Arrays/Array.js)

>## Linked Lists
>Linked List is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

>### Operations
>1. Access
>2. Search
>3. Insertion
>4. Deletion

>### Implementation
>1. [Singly Linked List](https://github.com/ricardo1470/Data-Structures/blob/master/Linked-Lists/SinglyLinkedList.js)
>2. [Doubly Linked List](https://github.com/ricardo1470/Data-Structures/blob/master/Linked-Lists/DoublyLinkedList.js)

>## Stacks
>Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).

>### Operations
>1. Push
>2. Pop
>3. Peek
>4. isEmpty

>### Implementation
>1. [Stack](https://github.com/ricardo1470/Data-Structures/blob/master/Stacks/Stack.js)

>## Queues
>Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

>### Operations
>1. Enqueue
>2. Dequeue
>3. Front
>4. Rear
>5. isEmpty

>### Implementation
>1. [Queue](https://github.com/ricardo1470/Data-Structures/blob/master/Queues/Queue.js)

>## Trees
>Tree is a non-linear data structure, with a hierarchical structure. It is a collection of nodes connected by edges. A tree has a root node and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.

>### Operations
>1. Traversal
>2. Insertion
>3. Deletion
>4. Search

>### Implementation

>1. [Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/ricardo1470/Data-Structures/blob/master/Trees/BinarySearchTree.js)

>## Graphs
>Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

>### Operations
>1. Traversal
>2. Insertion
>3. Deletion
>4. Search

>### Implementation
>1. [Graph](https://github.com/ricardo1470/Data-Structures/blob/master/Graphs/Graph.js)
>2. [Directed Graph](https://github.com/ricardo1470/Data-Structures/blob/master/Graphs/DirectedGraph.js)

>## Hash Tables
>Hash table is a data structure which is used to implement an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

>### Operations
>1. Insertion
>2. Deletion
>3. Search

>### Implementation
>1. [Hash Table](https://github.com/ricardo1470/Data-Structures/blob/master/Hash-Tables/HashTable.js)

>## Search Algorithms
>Search algorithms are used to find an element within a data structure. There are many different types of search algorithms, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

>### Operations
>1. Linear Search
>2. Binary Search

>### Implementation
>1. [Linear Search](/Data-Structures/Search-Algorithms/LinearSearch.js)
>2. [Binary Search](/Data-Structures/Search-Algorithms/BinarySearch.js)
>3. [Jump Search](/Data-Structures/Search-Algorithms/JumpSearch.js)
>4. [Interpolation Search](/Data-Structures/Search-Algorithms/InterpolationSearch.js)
>5. [Exponential Search](/Data-Structures/Search-Algorithms/ExponentialSearch.js)
>6. [Fibonacci Search](/Data-Structures/Search-Algorithms/FibonacciSearch.js)
>7. [Advanced binary search](/Data-Structures/Search-Algorithms/AdvancedBinarySearch.js)
>8. [Jump search in a singly linked list](/Data-Structures/Search-Algorithms/JumpSearchInSinglyLinkedList.js)
>9. [Linear search in a skip list](/Data-Structures/Search-Algorithms/LinearSearchInSkipList.js)
